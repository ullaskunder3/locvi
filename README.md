# LocVi

LocVi is a lightweight Flask-based local file browser that lets you poke around your files 📂, watch videos 🎬, listen to audio 🎧, and view images 🖼️ without losing your mind.
It remembers recent folders and the last file you opened… because we all forget stuff 😅.

Might add more features someday… maybe, or not 🤷‍♂️.

### ⚠️ Heads-Up on Cloud Deployment

> ⚡ Working on PWA functionality — currently in `test` branch 🚧 `pwa/locvi`

Locally, when you enter something like `C:\Users\ullas\Downloads\test`, Python/Flask happily accesses your local filesystem because, well… it lives on your machine 💻. `os.path.isdir(folder)` succeeds because the folder actually exists where your computer can see it ✅.

Now, if you try the same thing on Vercel (or any cloud server), things get… interesting 🤔. Your app is now running on a remote Linux server that has zero idea about your Windows paths. It can’t peek into `C:\Users\ullas\Downloads\test` because that folder is on your PC, not theirs 🚫.

Result: `os.path.isdir(folder)` returns `False` and you get the cheerful message: “Invalid folder. Try again.” 😬

So yeah — for now, if you want to try LocVi, just **clone or fork this repo locally** and run:

```bash
python run.py
# or
py run.py
```

Enjoy poking around your files 📁, watching videos 🎥, and marking things as “done” ✅ — all without a cloud server judging your folder structure 😎.

(Future plan: maybe one day we’ll make a proper web app 🌐 so everyone can use it online… but that’s a story for another time.)

### Why I Created It

I have tons of PDFs and other files across multiple subdirectories, and every time I want to read or watch something, I have to open, close, and hunt through folders. It’s annoying. I also often forget what I was reading or watching last, or what I’ve already finished.

So I built a **browser-based preview tool**—basically my attempt to improve on the frustrating Windows File Explorer experience.

---

### What It Does

- Paste any folder path and instantly view all files inside.
- Preview PDFs, videos, audio, images (PNG, JPEG, etc.), and text files.
- Sort files the way you want (default folder sorting is just frustrating).
- Remembers **recently opened folders** and **last viewed file**, inspired by VS Code.
- Checkbox indicator to mark files as “done reading/watching.” State is saved locally in JSON simple but effective.
- Gives hands-on experience with Python backend development while being genuinely useful.

---

### Current Limitations

- For **large folders**, rendering the file list can take a little time.
- Sometimes PDFs open in a **different tab** depending on the browser behavior.
- Does **not yet support large archives** (zip, rar, etc.)—only previews individual files.

---

### What’s Next

I love this project, and I’m thinking of:

- Learn algorithm so I can improve the speed and possible app for it
- Adding **search and filtering** for quick file lookup.
- Supporting more file types and larger files efficiently.
- Maybe a **small recommendation system** for files based on your reading/watching history.
- Learning more **backend concepts** to handle large directories smoothly.
